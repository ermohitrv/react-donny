==============

> Infinite scroll chat or feed component for React.js

This is an alpha release, use at your own risk!


### Warnings
 * no documentation, you'll have to read the source
 * no tests


### Live Demo
[![Live Demo](screenshot.png?raw=true)](http://musician-peggy-71735.bitballoon.com/)

Here is the [live demo](http://musician-peggy-71735.bitballoon.com/), and [source code to the live demo](https://github.com/dustingetz/messages), also [here is a simpler fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/dustingetz/xvqzw747/).


### Features
 * works as newsfeed or chat (infinite load down, infinite load up)
 * hardware accelerated scrolling
 * arbitrary height elements (react-infinite needs to know element heights in advance)
 * arbitrary height container (react-infinite needs to know container height in advance)
 * arbitrary browser layout & resize "just works"


### Mis-features
 * Not actually infinite - currently all elements that have been loaded remain the dom


### Things that will eventually work
 * auto-scroll to newest message when appropriate (pinning)
 * auto-correct scroll jitter when content resizes or is added above/below the focus point
 * configurable loading spinner
 * optimize for mobile (but it works)


There are probably more features missing. Please open an issue!

Please [let me know](https://twitter.com/dustingetz) if you use this, if this project is valued I will invest more time in it. Seriously, please, if you're reading this and want to use it, tweet me.


This work originated as a fork and modifications of [seatgeek/react-infinite](https://github.com/seatgeek/react-infinite), and was subsequently rewritten several times.
